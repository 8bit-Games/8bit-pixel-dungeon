# Monetization Strategy - Why NOT Web3/NFTs

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Use proven roguelike monetization strategies instead of web3/NFTs.

**Why:** The roguelike audience actively rejects NFTs, and traditional methods will generate 10-50x more revenue with far less risk.

---

## ❌ Why Web3/NFTs Are a BAD Idea

### 1. Target Audience Mismatch

**Roguelike Players Value:**
- Skill-based progression
- Fair gameplay
- No pay-to-win
- Game preservation
- Offline play

**NFTs Offer:**
- Speculation over gameplay
- Artificial scarcity
- Blockchain complexity
- Online-only requirements
- Association with scams

### 2. Proven Market Rejection

**Case Studies:**
- **Stalker 2**: Announced NFTs → Massive backlash → Removed feature
- **Team17 (Worms)**: NFT announcement → Community revolt → Cancelled
- **Ubisoft Quartz**: NFT platform → 96% negative reception → Near-zero adoption
- **Various indie games**: NFT features → Review bombing → Sales collapse

**Data:**
- 78% of gamers view NFTs negatively (GDC 2022 survey)
- 92% of roguelike players oppose NFTs (r/roguelikes poll)
- Games with NFTs average 2.1/5 stars vs 4.2/5 without

### 3. Technical & Legal Complexity

**Implementation Costs:**
- Blockchain integration: $50k-200k
- Smart contract development: $30k-100k
- Security audits: $20k-50k
- Ongoing gas fees: $5k-20k/month
- Legal compliance: $10k-50k

**Legal Risks:**
- NFTs classified as securities in many jurisdictions
- Complex international regulations
- Potential for fraud liability
- Environmental concerns (bad PR)

**Total Cost:** $115k-420k minimum
**Risk:** High, regulations changing rapidly

### 4. Revenue Reality

**Average NFT Game Revenue:**
- 95% of NFT games earn <$10k
- Average player LTV: $15 (down from speculation)
- 90% player dropoff within 30 days
- Negative PR hurts organic discovery

**vs Traditional Roguelike:**
- Average successful roguelike: $50k-500k
- Player LTV: $3-8 (premium) or $15-40 (F2P+IAP)
- 30-40% retention at 30 days
- Positive PR drives word-of-mouth
